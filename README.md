## Technical setup
You'll need [node and npm](https://nodejs.org/) to run the scripts in this repo, which will handle compiling your scss (and watching and recompiling as you develop).

Once you've got node running, simply fork this repo and begin writing your scss in styles/button.scss. 

Running `npm run build` will compile the scss in styles/; running `npm run watch` will compile the styles and recompile them each time you make a change to a .scss file.
